# Concerns to come back to.. 

- mongoDB->updateFingerprint()..
    The issue here is that the current method ovewrites the primary_fingerprint currently stored in the database... So far it seems fine because we only really peruse a position once. However we might want to change the overwriting nature of the scan.

- The slight change in antenna height caused a drastic shift in the normal distribution. There exists quite a distinct change. It is worth experimenting on.

- very much need to add known towers
